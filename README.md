During the first lecture we divided the workload so that everyone had a specific part to do. 
We follow this school of thought : " too many cocks in the barn won't solve the problem". This means that every team member
will choose a specific feature to work on and their will come up with a solution.
This resulted on a more organized project. However, before implementing the solution each member 
will show and explain it to the rest of the team, so that everyone can discuss it and try to improve it. 
In paralell with the solutionEvery team member will develop documentation (mostly atm diagrams and code z.B. Arduino Sketches properly commented)
If protocols or a description of the project is required, it will be described here in more details.

The group will meet at least once per week (outside the timetable) where solutions will be discussed and implemented. 
Every team member is responsible for one feature, and will work on that during their own time. 

We will try to use the Waterfall method as Software process model. This will give us a very fixed methodology and steps
to follow before implementing the effective solution. In combination with this method, howevere, we will also use the incremental 
development method. The incremental development method is more flexible regarding the feedback from the costumer (or in this
case the professor). 
Using those two methods, we will be able to have the benefit of a organized workflow which will allow us to coordinate each team's work
(Waterfall Method )with the possibility to accomodate every possible change in requirenments. Another strategy we will apply is dividing
the solutions in versions and we will upload every one of them here on this repository. This allow us to follow the "80% rule" (Usually
if the 80% of the solution is implemented is enugh, sell the rest 20 with updates). 

Before implementing further and more complicated feature, the group will meet to discuss a paper prototpe to follow, so that we will have a 
model from which we will base every and each update (error correction, new features and so on).

The team has a whatsapp group with which will communicate solutions and status updates.
